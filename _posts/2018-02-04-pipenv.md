Pipenv is a great new way to manage virtual environments without needing to use pip and virtualenv seperately. 

To start a new pipenv in the current directory (using python 3.x):
```
pipenv --three
```

To install packages within the new virtual environment:
```
pipenv install <package>
```

To activate the virtual environment:
```
pipenv shell
```
